# KLohMDSFinalProject

This package allows users to access data posted on the United States government Department of Education official developer hub. Specifically, the Public School Enrollment API, 1 of 3 'Civil Rights Data Collection' (CRDC) APIs. This data provides Public School Information on the number of students enrolled in public education in 2013-2014 by race/ethnicity, gender, and program status. Unfortuntaely, due to the current political climate, the CRDC API has been limited; in the data dictionary for the Public School Enrollment, there are almost `2000` categories of data. As of December 2018, only 66 categories of data remain 'GET-able'. As such, the author of this R Package plans to update the package with new capabilities and filtering options as data becomes available.
