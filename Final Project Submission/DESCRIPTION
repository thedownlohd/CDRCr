Description: This file gives access to the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) API, and specifically the Public School Enrollment data for 2013-2014.
    Regrettably, the other two other CRDC APIs, for Chronic Absenteeism in 2013-2014 and Out-of-School Suspension in 2013-2014 are not functional as of December, 2018. 
    This package also contains a small 2010 Census dataset, in order to provide some information of state populations generally when comparing with population of school aged children.
