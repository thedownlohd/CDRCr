# Modern Data Structures Homework #1

## 2. Let's get some data

Of the datasets contained in the fivethirtyeight package, I'm most interested in the `democratic_bench` dataset, which holds poll related to the amount of money expected to be raised and actually raised by prominent Democratic politicians. FiveThirtyEight used this data as a clue as to who was considering running for president in 2016 if Hillary Clinton decided not to run.



```{r echo=FALSE}
data (package = "fivethirtyeight")

```

In order to get a sense of what the dataset shows, I used the ?() function. The `democratic_bench` data is a data frame with 67 rows representing members of the Democratic Party, the the three following variables: `candidate`, `raised_exp`, and `raised_act`. 

```{r}
?democratic_bench
```

## 3. Let's show the data

Please note that for Question #3 I split it into three parts, and hid the code for each one. In 3a I use the `summary()` function to get a simple summary. In 3b I use the `datatable()` function to get an interactive table, and in 3c I call another table using the `kable()` function.

### 3a. Provide a simple summary of the data with summary() command.
```{r echo=FALSE}

summary(democratic_bench)

```

### 3b. Use the command datatable from the package `DT` to show an interactive table of your data in the document
```{r echo=FALSE}

datatable(democratic_bench)

```

### 3c. Now add another non-interactive table using the kable function in the knitr package. Choose a sensible subset of the data (or a transformation of the data) to show. Prettify the column names a bit.

I added the kable library above, and ordered the data in alphabetical order then printed the first 5 Democratic Candidates. I also changed the column headers.

```{r echo=FALSE}
new_df = data.frame(democratic_bench)
ordered_df <- new_df[order(democratic_bench$candidate),]
ordered_df <- kable(ordered_df, col.names = c('Democratic Candidate',
                                'Expected $ Raised',
                                'Actual $ Raised'))

print(ordered_df [1:7])

```

## 4. Add some LaTex formulas.
### Think of some (any) model you run on the data you chose. This does not need to be sensible - for this homework, the formatting is the objective, the content is secondary. Briefly describe the model using a Latex formula in the text.

I think the model I would use would use k Nearest Neighbors model on multiple years of presidential elections. I would look at the residuals of each election of each candidate, and then make a prediction based on the magnitude of the residual. In this case, I would be measure the $$\epsilon$$ value in the function below.

$$ y = b_0 + (b_1)x + \epsilon $$
I'm pretty sure you could do a kNN on this problem as well. The general linear classification function is:

$$score(X_ik = B_k \cdot X_i)$$


## 5. Add a plot
I added the plot and then added axis labels.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

i <- ggplot(democratic_bench, aes(raised_exp, raised_act)) + geom_point() + xlab('Expected $ Raised') + ylab('Actual $ Raised') + ggtitle('Scatter Plot of Democratic Bench Candidates Fundraising')

print(i)
```

## 6. Add a Picture

Arguably better than who we have now.

## 7. Add a footnote and a block quote.

This is a test footnote[^1]
